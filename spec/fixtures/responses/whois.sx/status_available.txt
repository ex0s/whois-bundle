% WHOIS LEGAL STATEMENT AND TERMS & CONDITIONS
% The WHOIS service offered by OpenRegistry and the access to the
% records in the OpenRegistry WHOIS database are provided for information
% purposes only. It allows persons to check whether a specific domain name
% is still available or not and to obtain information related to the
% registration records of existing domain names. You are not authorized to
% access or query our WHOIS  database through the use of electronic
% processes that are high-volume and  automated except as reasonably
% necessary to register domain names or modify existing registrations.
%
% OpenRegistry cannot, under any circumstances, be held liable should the
% stored information prove to be wrong, incomplete or inaccurate in any sense.
%
% By submitting a WHOIS query you agree not to use the information made
% available to:
%   - Allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited,
%     commercial advertising or other solicitations whether via email, telephone
%     or otherwise;
%   - Target advertising in any possible way;
%   - Cause nuisance in any possible way to the registrants by sending (whether
%     by automated, electronic processes capable of enabling high volumes or
%     other possible means) messages to them.
%
% Without prejudice to the above, it is explicitly forbidden to extract, copy
% and/or use or re-utilise in any form and  by any means (electronically or
% not) the whole or a quantitatively or qualitatively substantial part of the
% contents of the WHOIS database without prior and explicit permission by
% OpenRegistry, nor in any attempt hereof, to apply automated, electronic
% processes to OpenRegistry (or its systems).
%
% By submitting the query you agree that any reproduction and/or transmission
% of data for commercial purposes will always be considered as the extraction
% of a substantial part of the content of the WHOIS database. You also agree
% to abide by this policy and accept that OpenRegistry can take measures to
% limit the use of its WHOIS services in order to protect the privacy of its
% registrants and/or the integrity of the database. OpenRegistry reserves the
% right  to restrict your access to the WHOIS database in its sole discretion
% to ensure operational stability.  OpenRegistry may restrict or terminate your
% access to the WHOIS database for failure to abide by these terms of use.
%
% OpenRegistry reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.
